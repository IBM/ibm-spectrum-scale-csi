IBM Spectrum Scale
==================

IBM Spectrum Scale is a clustered file system providing concurrent access to a single file system or set of file systems 
from multiple nodes. The nodes can be SAN attached, network attached, a mixture of SAN attached and network attached, or 
a shared nothing cluster configuration. This enables high performance access to this common set of data to support a 
scale-out solution or to provide a high availability platform.

IBM Spectrum Scale has many features beyond common data access including data replication, policy based storage management, 
and multi-site operations. You can create a cluster of AIXÂ® nodes, Linux nodes, Windows server nodes, or a mix of all three. 
IBM Spectrum Scale can run on virtualized instances providing common data access in environments, leverage logical partitioning, 
or other hypervisors. Multiple IBM Spectrum Scale clusters can share data within a location or across wide area network (WAN) 
connections.
