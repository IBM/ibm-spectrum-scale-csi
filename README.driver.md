In static provisioning, the backend storage volumes and PVs are created by the administrator. Static provisioning can be used to provision a directory or fileset with existing data.

For static provisioning of existing directories perform the following steps:

- Generate static pv yaml file using helper script

   ```
   tools/generate_pv_yaml.sh --filesystem gpfs0 --size 10 \
   --linkpath /ibm/gpfs0/pvfileset/static-pv --pvname static-pv
   ```

- For static provisioning, refer following sample pvc and pod files for sanity test

   ```
   driver/examples/static/static_pvc.yaml
   driver/examples/static/static_pod.yaml
   ```
  

## Dynamic Provisioning

Dynamic provisioning is used to dynamically provision the storage backend volume based on the storageClass.

### Storageclass
Storageclass defines what type of backend volume should be created by dynamic provisioning. IBM Spectrum Scale CSI driver supports creation of directory based (also known as lightweight volumes) and fileset based (independent as well as dependent) volumes. Following parameters are supported by IBM Spectrum Scale CSI driver storageClass:

 - **volBackendFs**: Filesystem on which the volume should be created. This is a mandatory parameter.
 - **clusterId**: Cluster ID on which the volume should be created. 
 - **volDirBasePath**: Base directory path relative to the filesystem mount point under which directory based volumes should be created. If specified, the storageClass is used for directory based (lightweight) volume creation.
 - **uid**: UID with which the volume should be created. Optional
 - **gid**: UID with which the volume should be created. Optional
 - **filesetType**: Type of fileset. Valid values are "independent" or "dependent". Default: independent
 - **parentFileset**: Specifies the parent fileset under which dependent fileset should be created.
 - **inodeLimit**: Inode limit for fileset based volumes. If not specified, default IBM Spectrum Scale inode limit of 1 million is used.
 
For dynamic provisioning, refer following sample storageClass, pvc and pod files for sanity test

Example:

   ```
   driver/examples/dynamic/fileset/storageclassfileset.yaml
   driver/examples/dynamic/fileset/pvcfileset.yaml
   driver/examples/dynamic/fileset/podfileset.yaml
   ```
