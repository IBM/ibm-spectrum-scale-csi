The IBM Spectrum Scale Container Storage Interface (CSI) project enables container orchestrators, such as Kubernetes and OpenShift, to manage the life-cycle of persistent storage.

This project contains an ansible-based operator to run and manage the deployment of the IBM Spectrum Scale CSI Driver. 

If you are looking to deploy released versions of the IBM Spectrum Scale CSI Operator, consider starting at: 

  * OpenShift - Under Operator -> OperatorHub in the OpenShift Console, search 'IBM Spectrum Scale CSI" and install
  * Kubernetes -  See the project on [OperatorHub.io - ibm-spectrum-scale-csi-operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/ibm-spectrum-scale-csi-operator)
