# IBM Spectrum Scale CSI (Container Storage Interface)

[Official IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-scale-csi)


The IBM Spectrum Scale Container Storage Interface (CSI) project enables container orchestrators, such as Kubernetes and OpenShift, to manage the life-cycle of persistent storage.

This project contains an [ansible-based operator](https://sdk.operatorframework.io) to run and manage the deployment of the IBM Spectrum Scale CSI Driver.

If you are looking to deploy released versions of the IBM Spectrum Scale CSI Operator, consider starting at: 

  * OpenShift - Under Operator -> OperatorHub in the OpenShift Console, search 'IBM Spectrum Scale CSI" and install
  * Kubernetes -  See the project on [OperatorHub.io - ibm-spectrum-scale-csi-operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/ibm-spectrum-scale-csi-operator)
